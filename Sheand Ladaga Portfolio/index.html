                <h3>From University of Cebu</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I see myself developing into a digital innovator as well as a web developer as I go along on this adventure. The abilities I'm developing now will help shape tomorrow's constantly evolving digital environment.
                    I am well-positioned to change with the web, keeping a close eye on cutting-edge technologies like responsive design, progressive web apps, and artificial intelligence.
                    
                    Being a student who wants to become a web developer is a path filled with creativity, progress, and ongoing learning. Every step—from understanding the fundamentals to managing sophisticated technologies—testifies to my commitment to this ever-evolving field.
                    I am actively influencing the future of the digital world in addition to studying web development since I have an insatiable thirst for information and a passion for creating digital experiences.

                <p> Hi! I'm Sheand. I'm a first year Information Technology studen from University of Cebu.
                    Born in Queen City of the South, Cebu City. Growing up in this technological world, I embeded the importance of being internet literate.
                    
                    My academic journey has been a voyage of discovery, marked by a curiosity for knowledge and a thirst for intellectual challenges. From Don Vicente Rama Memorial National High School to my current endeavors in University of Cebu,
                    I've embraced a variety of subjects that have broadened my perspective and nurtured a love for lifelong learning.
                    
                    As I gaze out into the distance, my goals serve as the compass that directs my course. Whether it's to work as a web developer, where I want to have considerable positive influence, or to work as an educator, teaching the next generation of kids the value of media literacy.
                    My dreams and my personal goals give me the drive to succeed. Since the route holds equal significance as the destination, I pledge to relish each and every moment of the journey.

                <h2>Cloud Service</h2>
                <p>Cloud services help businesses leverage the on-demand benefits of the internet with a cloud service provider. The cloud can replace the need for on-premise servers with little capital investment.
                    These services appeal to most due to ease of use, scalability, and immediate access to company resources. The only physical requirement on your part is a dependable internet connection.</p>

                <i class='bx bx-signal-5' ></i>
                <h2>Network Security</h2>
                <p>Along with all of the benefits provided by internet access come a myriad of security risks. Hackers, spammers, viruses, and data thieves run rampant across the internet, and without strict network security measures in place, your business’s data is constantly endangered.</p>

                <h2>Help Desk Support</h2>
                <p>Help desk support is a vital tool for any business that doesn’t have an in-house IT team. Help desk support can vary depending on your business’s needs, but it’s most commonly used as a single point of contact for users who need occasional help with troubleshooting computers, printers, networks, wifi, etc.</p>

                <h2>IT Consulting</h2>
                <p>Sometimes an IT project is too large or technical to plan without having an experienced team of IT professionals on hand. If that’s the case, hiring your IT service provider for consulting services may be the solution. They can work with multiple departments or contractors to tackle projects like large-scale hardware and infrastructure overhauls or business-wide software and operating system updates, ensuring that no technical detail is overlooked.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Computer Training</h2>
                <p>One of the largest hurdles that businesses face in keeping their software and operating systems up to date is training everyone on the newly updated systems. With the Windows 7 end of life drawing near, this issue keeps growing more relevant.
                The next time you contact your IT service provider about updating your systems, ask them about providing a computer training session for your employees as well.</p>
